A farmer toils in fields of green,

The morning dew upon the scene.

His plow cuts through the earth with ease,

A gentle breeze rustles the trees.

<BR>

The sun begins its climb on high,

A bird takes flight across the sky.

The farmer works from dawn till dusk,

To feed the land, a noble task.

<BR>

With sweat upon his furrowed brow,

The farmer turns his plow to plow.

His hands are calloused, rough and worn,

But his spirit is never torn.

<BR>

For he knows that the harvest waits,

A bounty worth the toil and weight.

And in the end, he’ll reap what’s sown,

A livelihood that’s all his own.
