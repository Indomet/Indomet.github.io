From my grossly oversimplified, "boilerplate" social media bio:

*"Photojournalist, photographer, writer, code jockey, former USCG engineer and avid reader of philosophical works from the Age of Enlightenment et al and the Three Teachings. Also a coffee fiend. Author of the novel '[The Beauty of Aqua](https://archive.org/details/the_beauty_of_aqua).'”*

So who am I? I'm a photojournalist, writer and code jockey. I truly enjoy all three of those endeavors and always have. Also a father of three good children but that role always stands alone. Please let me elaborate on the first three roles.

<H3>On being a photojournalist</H3>

I started writing local news stories for a weekly newspaper in my town at 19 and soon after also started working as a news videographer and writer for the only local TV station. My style was whatever the Associated Press Stylebook told me it should be. No allegory, no onomatopoeias and no semicolons. Certainly no independent clauses to go with that forbidden punctuation. Even the use three syllable words that weren't proper nouns was routinely edited out. My "style" was as simple as plain oatmeal. But that wasn't my greatest sin.

To paraphrase George Orwell "writing is printing what someone else does not want published; everything else is public relations.” I was expected to ignore stories that would embarrass local officials be it their repeated drunk driving to our local US Congressman having a sexual relationship with a 16 year old assigned to him. To tell the unvarnished truth meant losing access to local officials which meant losing viewers which meant losing advertisers. I liked writing meaningful stories about the lives of our locals but I grew tired of all the "public relations" work required of me.

Thankfully I had a way out that would last a few months at a time. At seventeen I enlisted in the US Coast Reserves and would soon after pick-up repeated temporary active duty assignments when I could. This allowed me to stay close to my family home while also living a life of meaningful work, peppered with danger like serving as the engineer on the venerated USCG 44' Motorized lifeboat out in the North Atlantic Ocean. It was the last open cockpit MLB in USCG service. 

Starting around then began to drift away from journalism and back to writing software. The joy of software is that it either works or it doesn't. There's comfort in being in the more "black and white" world of computing than being in the rather nebulas world of journalism. 

Over the years I drifted between writing for silicon and writing for carbon [based lifeforms]. As the expansion of the Internet laid waste to journalism I became more selective of what I wrote and for whom. 

I still practice the craft of photojournalism and still much in the same "old school" style, just for a very few places that still respect said still. I have reputation not as that "uber creative" writer or photographer but as the photojournalist that will always return on time with the story, a half dozen bog-standard images and no excuses.

Remember my previous comment about style, or imparticular the lack of it? This is where I broke free.

No writer worth reading is ever happy because writing worth reading is born from suffering. At 19 I was a US Coast Guardsman and engineer performing search-and-rescue and recovery operations in the North Atlantic Ocean. Spoiler alert: most rescues don't take place on calm, sunny days. They take place when nature is at their angriest. Sometimes we brought folks home to their loved-ones alive and sometimes we brought them home to their loved-ones dead.

With that said most of my life was spent writing mostly meaningless works for others, never myself. I rarely had the motivation to write in my own voice until a decade ago when I almost died from stage four cancer. Now writing is almost everything to me.
 
<H3>On being a code jockey</H3>
Writing code is my "happy place." Good programmers code because it's what they love to do, not because someone told them to "learn to code." Writing good code is an art and when it comes together a joy. It's akin to a "super power." Steve Job's called the personal computer a "bicycle for the mind." A tool that made the average computer user much more efficient at completing many task than they'd ever been before. And us code jockeys built those "bicycles for the mind." 

Even after decades of writing code I still get excited about writing anything from an app for a client to a complex bash script to automate a process that should be automated. Again, building "bicycles for the mind."

During that time while writing code at home I raised my three children almost completely by myself as my spouse was much more involved in her job than our children. Hard? Sure. Rewarding? Absolutely. Most important job I ever had? Without a doubt yes. I honored to spend a couple days a week and weekends with my son which is a nice reminder of those good times.

These days I mostly code on a Mac Mini and a beat-up Windows laptop that refuses to run Linux but no big deal as I've always got a ssh session or two open to my Mac. I used Android Studio for my Flutter work and VS Code for most everything else.

<H3>Other questions answered</H3>

<H4>What else can I say?</H4>
I'm a former expatriate having lived in Việt Nam for almost two years. I moved back to the US because it was time. Yes, I flew back and forth a couple times a year but it wasn't the same as really "being back." I loved every moment living there but I saw the descent of the US and could no longer stand by and do nothing. I was reminded about how Bác Hồ enjoyed living in Paris, lived a fairly comfortable life, but his heart hurt because of the pain his homeland and her people were suffering from. He knew the only way to be free is to resist tyranny.

I follow the "three teachings" of Daoism, Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism. While very different I see them similar to a three legged stool where all three legs offer balance. 

I embrace the Dao as taught by both Laozi and Zhuangzi but I am not a Daoist. I've read from the Dàodé Jīng every night before bed and have for years. If I could only have one book for the rest of my life that would be it.

I follow the teachings of the Buddha but I am not a Buddhist. I find the teachings of the Buddha to be a well-lit path towards liberation and Thích Nhất Hạnh's book "[Old Path, White Clouds](https://archive.org/details/OldPathWhiteClouds)" to be the best fictional account of the life of the Buddha. 

And I find comfort in Confucianism in particular the idea of being a good and benevolent person, following proper conduct, etiquette and rituals and respect, obedience, and care for one's parents and ancestors. Also the importance of loyalty can not be forgotten. While not directly related to Confucianism I always try to clean my home a few days before Tết Nguyên Đán in preparation for the Kitchen God's annual inspection. Rituals that bring us together as community often are good, rituals that tear a community apart are often not.

My photography style can be summarized as "digital photography with an analog flow." I started photography with a 1970's Pentax SP 1000 and rolling my own Kodak Tri-X monochrome film. When I had a few extra dollars I splurged on Kodachrome. I now shoot on a pair of decade old Fujifilm X-T1 bodies and a high milage Fujifilm X100T that shares most of the same internals of the X-T1 bodies. They've been to Korea, China, Laos, Thailand many times, and of course Việt Nam, and have never failed me. I shoot JPEGs because Photoshop never got Fujifilm's film simulations from the X-Trans II sensor right and it's always made a mess when I comes to sharpening. Being from the days of film I got use to the idea of getting it right in the camera. I'm skilled at Photoshop and have spent hours editing a single image for friends and myself but I'd rather be shooting.

While my motorcycling days are mostly behind me there is a special joy of being on two wheels that never leaves you. I've ridden parts of the original Hồ Chí Minh trail, both the short and long ways around Son Tra mountain and the Hải Vân Pass which the boys from "Top Gear" called one of the most beautiful roads they've ever ridden.

Finally my politics which would be best summarized as supporting libertarian socialism, something very similar to Việt Nam's "[Đổi Mới](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%95i_M%E1%BB%9Bi)" or a socialist-oriented market economy. Anarchist economic policies on the micro level and socialist economic policies on the macro level. Something that's served Việt Nam quite well.

<H4>Future plans?</H4>
As for creative writing I've got three more novels in the works and a myriad of short works that need to be written.

I'm currently working working book two "Return to Aqua" in the four novel series "The Beauty of Aqua." When the last book is complete all four will be released as a single novel weighing in at roughly 1,300 pages. It takes a lot of words to write about person's entire life. Like book one "[The Beauty of Aqua](https://archive.org/details/the_beauty_of_aqua)" all will be released on the Internet Archive and under a Creative Commons noncommercial "share alike" license. While commercially for sale unless you want a print copy please go to the IA and download a copy for free. Free is good.

As for software I've got a few small projects I have been meaning to release. 

I've been a fan of the Grateful Dead for decades and been bothered by the fact a few years ago the Internet Archive was forced to make all "soundboard" versions of Dead concerts streaming only. The fact is if you can listen to an audio file that's unencumbered with DRM you can also download it and saying you can't is kabuki. So I wrote some handy bash scripts that will let users input an IA Grateful Dead show ID and in return they'll be rewarded with a well organized group of high quality, audio files.

I've also written some handy bash scripts that, for purely educational purposes only, shows how one can easily download music in a very simple and well organized manner from music.youtube.com. Again, this is meant only for educating programmers in ways of accessing assets not using an API. It is not meant in any way, shape or form to make unauthorized copies of music. 

Otherwise I have no long term plans because I pretty much have no "long term" future. About a decade ago I was treated for stage four cancer and while the cancer was eradicated the very invasive treatment has shortened my life. A decade ago after treatment was complete I was given at best another ten years and that time has passed. Life is uncertain, death can come upon us at anytime and for me knowing my days ahead are short is comforting compared to the uncertainty most people live in fear of. 

<H4>Why host on github.io?</H4>
I like Github, I like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) especially with the "[chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/)" theme used here and I like static web pages for their speed. While my days of writing html files in emacs are long gone Jekyll is a very nice compromise between hand-crafting web pages and the soullessness of dynamic frameworks like Wordpress. 

Also I'm deeply committed to the ethos behind open source software. I've got a few projects that have been sitting unused for far too long and my plan is to release them over time so others can use whatever they see useful for their open source projects.

Please don't get me wrong. As someone that thoroughly enjoys working in [Flutter's](https://flutter.dev/showcase) very dynamic framework they have their place, but that doesn't mean their place is everywhere.

So who am I? As Niko Bellic said "life is complicated" and so isn't every person that has examined their life. I'm an amalgamation of many different experiences. 

If you're got a question or just need someone to talk to please message me. It's important to be a good, nonjudgmental listener and welcome the chance to become better at that skill.
